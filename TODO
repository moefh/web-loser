In no particular order:

*) Minimap

Draw a small rectangle on the corner of the screen showing a small
version of the current map.  In the original Loser Corps the image was
based on the collision map (available in this version as 'map.clip'),
not the map tiles, but this might be changed.

Transparency would be nice.


*) Map objects

The map files specify an attribute "objects", an array of map objects.
An object's "npc" attribute specifies its behaviour (e.g. "shadow" is
an enemy, "energy" is an energy capsule, "tele/teleporter" is a
teleporter source, "tele/teletarget" is a teleport target, etc.).

Not all object attributes are relevant (e.g. "vulnerability" only
applies to enemies).


*) Multiplayer

Some kind of multiplayer involving a server.


*) Map editor

Current maps are exported from the original maps using maps/src/conv.
The original map editor is awful, we should make a new one.
