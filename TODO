In no particular order:

*) Player health

Implement player attributes like health and weapon power level.


*) Minimap

Improve minimap, it's too ugly.


*) Map objects

The map files specify an attribute "objects", an array of map objects.
An object's "npc" attribute specifies its behaviour (e.g. "shadow" is
an enemy, "energy" is an energy capsule, "tele/teleporter" is a
teleporter source, "tele/teletarget" is a teleport target, etc.).

Not all object attributes are relevant (e.g. "vulnerability" only
applies to enemies).


*) Multiplayer

Some kind of multiplayer involving a server.


*) Map editor

Current maps are exported from the original maps using maps/src/conv.
The original map editor is awful, we should make a new one.
