# web-loser

An adaptation of the [Loser Corps](http://loser.sourceforge.net/) game to Javascript.

This is just a proof-of-concept: you can move around and shoot, but map triggers and enemy AI
are not functional (no item pickups, no doors, emenies just walk left/right and can't be shot),
although blue stars (teleports) work.

## Demo

Run it [here](https://moefh.github.io/web-loser/).

Controls:

key           | action
--------------|-----------------------------------
left arrow    | move left
right arrow   | move right
up arrow      | jump
x             | shoot
